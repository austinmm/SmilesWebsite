# CptS 322: Software Engineering Principles I
## Intro Project: SmilesWebsite
## Project Description: Smile is an app that was one of the initial projects I had to complete for my Software Engineering Principles Course (CptS 322). It allows anyone the ability to share experiences from their day that made them smile and things people did that they are grateful for. It's inspired by the Gratitude Journal. Psychologists did a series of research experiments where they had individuals write down three things they are grateful for each day, and it significantly boosted their happiness. But instead of keeping a super secret personal journal, why not spread the happiness? We know some people write pretty personal things, so all posts will be anonymous.
